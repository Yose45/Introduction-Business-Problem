(If no other Ethiopian restaurants are located here.)\n-\tTo create community networking and public relation among Ethiopians in the area. \n-\tTo provide Injera also knows as the Ethiopian spongy bread with a reasonable price to the community since making this bread at home will cost a lot of time and money. (Injera is the crepe-like bread made from the grain teff on which spicy Ethiopian food is served and eaten communally by hand). \n-\tMany Americans and foreign nationals are looking for new food experience and this provides the opportunity to let customers try and enjoy a broad range of tasty exotic dishes. \n\n"
